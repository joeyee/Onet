## Introduction
In marine radar domain, there are very few labeled datasets for training the deep neural networks. In this work, we propose an **unsupervised model** for binary semantic segmentation in marine radar images. Additionally, we demonstrate its efficiency for cloud detection in remote sensing images.

The basic idea behind this model is that, in marine radar images, the main distinction between the foreground and background is their **intensity**. A normalized image $X$ highlights the foreground, while its reverse, $1-X$, emphasizes the background. By feeding the network with the complementary input pair $(X, 1-X)$, the features of the foreground and background can be contrastively learned within the same feature space. 

Considering that shallow convolutional networks capture **local intensity**  variations, while deeper layers extract **global features**, it is beneficial to connect the shallow and deep layers directly to emphasize the influence of intensity on classification. This idea aligns well with the U-Net architecture, which uses skip connections to integrate features between the encoding and decoding layers. 

Motivated by these insights, we utilize the initial layer for local feature expression and the final layer for global feature extraction in the U-Net network. The class probability maps are then generated by projecting the global features onto the local features at the corresponding locations. The segmentation probability is expected to heavily depend on the numerical distributions of the local features. 

To strengthen this dependence, we propose to maximize the mutual information between local features and segmentation scores by raising its lower bound, the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) [[mine2019]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bklr3j0cKX), [[infoseg2021]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03477). To effectively handle the complementary input pairs, we propose a dual U-Net architecture which is called Onet in this paper due to its O-shaped structure.
